## Counter Application
The purpose of this document is :
- to present how to read into the counter data model - what is the process to lead you from raw
logs to a Counter data model,
- to help you to identify if your logs are usable or not,
- to help you identify the co-workers that are able to answer these questions and work with us
during this project.
